# Python-Loops

```
A loop in Python is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly.
 Python supports two main types of loops: for loops and while loops. 
```
 ```
#### For Loop:
Used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects.
 The code block within the loop is executed once for each item in the sequence.
```
```
    for item in sequence:
        # Code to be executed for each item
```



```
#### While loop: 
Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
The loop continues until the condition becomes false. 
```
